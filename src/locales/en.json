We are part of DDS - The Danish Scout Corps and Horns Rev Division. At DDS, we work from the scout idea that was founded by Lord BADEN-POWELL in England over 100 years ago! Does that sound boring? - It is not! We do not only use maps and compasses to find our way. It's easier with GPS. We have learned the second thing. We do not always follow old ladies across the road, we would rather go for long walks, make bonfires, toast marshmallows, build with rafters, sing, dance, play, get crazy ideas and try them out, cuddle in the sleeping bag, laugh, giggle, scout tease. There is also something you must not do: namely to bully, be a leader, not help each other. And we dare and will make demands on our scouts. DDS is not affiliated with any religion, we hold all faiths.",
        "title2": "Our goals",
        "text2": "Some of our goals are: We want to be forward-looking and determined. We dare to develop children and young people to take part in and take responsibility for themselves and society. We dare to show profit and willingness to take risks. We do development, training and education that the scouts can use in their daily scout work. And later in their working lives. We trade and develop the scouts via the focus areas: Scouts against bullying. Scouts for attention to nature and the environment. Scouts for a healthy body and good food. Scouts for increased integration into society.",

        "group1text": "Many kids start as Mikro-scouts. This is where the foundation of friendship, community and outdoor life is built. Mikro Scouting is about being together, learning and playing. They learn to cut, make bonfires, build and other exciting things. With a scout cabin as a permanent hut, filled with equipment that everyone can use, they spend a lot of time singing, playing games and telling stories. There is always one or more adult present. The mikros are all about creating friendships and teamwork, and everyone is welcome.",
        "group2text": "The minis have nature as their playground. A lot of time is spent outdoors, training scout skills. The minis go on small cabin or camping trips, doing tasks in the woods like tracking animals, working with navigation (maps and compasses) and practice tying knots and using knives. They solve exciting problems together, in groups. The minis work in patrols, beginning with weekly meetings to plan activities. The patrol is important to scouts, as they solve tasks together, with help from experienced scouts and leaders.",
        "group3text": "The Juniors are very active. They go on trips, trying new activities, where they learn to protect nature and take care of themselves. The Juniors meet in the scout cabin, arrange trips, sleep in tents and cook over a campfire. They train in basic scout skills, like handling an axe and setting up a tent alone. Juniors get more responsibility, organized in patrols where they work together to solve tasks but gain more independence and experience as scouts. They are more experienced scouts than the Minis and Mikros, but still receive oversight from the older scouts and leaders.",
        "group4text": "The Troop scouts demand more from each scout than before. They participate in camaraderie, fun and challenging activities but with more individual responsibility. They go on camp and hiking trips, where they rely on their scouting skills and experience. They organize their own patrol meetings, together with a patrol leader the same age. They make their own decisions on how meetings and activities take place, but can always get guidance from older scout leaders, and take courses to become patrol leaders themselves. Troops also get opportunities to meet other scouts from all over the world. They are divided into patrols, typically of 5-6 scouts, composed of a patrol leader and assistant, who plan the scout activities based on material from the corps.",
        "group5text": "The Klan scouts are composed of scouts aged 16-25 and senior scouts, those who have been troop scouts for 3 years. The Klan scouts put all their skills to the test organizing and managing events and activities for the younger scouts. They organize and plan projects for the scouts that range from knot boards to long-term construction projects - only the imagination is the limit. Many senior scouts also act as leaders in the group and meet weekly for coffee, tea and cake to organize scouting activity, even with leaders from other scout groups across Denmark. Even though they are older and more experienced, they don’t stop coming to camps and participating with the younger scouts in many of the fun activities they partake in. Senior scouts have a lot of control over how they spend their time, either overseeing big, long-term projects or just organizing small camp trips with the younger scouts. Klan scouts have the opportunity to develop their leadership skills with courses and international scout work, forming long-term friendships and connections along the way. Courses in the Esbjerg municipality are free to attend, and are applicable to both scout work and careers where leadership skills are required."
